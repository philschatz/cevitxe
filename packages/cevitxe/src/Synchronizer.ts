/**
 * One instance of `Synchronizer` keeps one local document in sync with one remote peer's replica of the
 * same document.
 *
 * This class works with a local `Repo`; it listens for changes to documents, and if it thinks it
 * has changes that the remote peer doesn't know about, it generates a message to be sent the peer.
 * It also processes messages from its counterpart on the peer, and applies them to local documents
 * as needed.
 *
 * This class doesn't get involved in the actual transmission of the messages; it only generates
 * them for someone else to send, and processes them when someone else receives them. To integrate a
 * connection with a particular networking stack, two functions are used:
 *
 * - `send` (callback passed to the constructor, will be called when local state is updated) takes a
 *   message as argument, and sends it out to the remote peer.
 * - `receive` (method on the connection object) should be called by the network stack when a
 *   message is received from the remote peer.
 *
 * In this context, networking is provided by the Cevitxe `Connection` class.
 *
 * The document to be synced is managed by a `Repo`. Whenever it is changed locally, call `setDoc()`
 * on the Repo. The connection registers a callback on the repo, and it figures out whenever there
 * are changes that need to be sent to the remote peer.
 *
 * To do this, we keep track of two clocks: ours and theirs.
 *
 * - "Their" clock is the most recent VClock that we think the peer has (either because they've told
 *   us that it's their clock, or because it corresponds to a state we have sent to them on this
 *   connection). Thus, everything more recent than theirClock should be sent to the peer.
 *
 * - "Our" clock is the most recent VClock that we've advertised to the peer (i.e. where we've told
 *   the peer that we have it).
 *
 * > Note: This class began life as a vendored & refactored copy of the `Automerge.Connection`
 * > class; if you're familiar with that class, this one plays exactly the same role.
